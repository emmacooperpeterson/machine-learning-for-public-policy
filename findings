- Five most common wards: 17, 34, 16, 15, 28 (Auburn Gresham, Lyons, West Englewood, Brighton Park, North Lawndale)
- 'Completion' dates are not reported
- 24,413 properties are marked as being used by homeless individuals, children, gangs, etc.

Interesting findings:
- There is not much overlap in terms of the five wards reporting the most issues for each of these 311 categories. 
  Only two wards show up in the top five in more than one category.
- Almost 18,000 reported pot holes had already been filled when someone arrived to fill them.  
  This suggests a major issue in the process for tracking the status of these reports.
- Many of these reports/requests are addressed fairly quickly: 97% of graffiti requests 
  and 94% of sanitation complaints are addressed within 30 days. There is more room for improvement when it
  comes to reports of potholes â€“ 75% are addressed within 30 days.
- Of the three report types that include a completion date, pot holes are the most likely to
  go unaddressed for more than one year.
- The wards included in the 'Five most common wards' sections above are more likely to be located South of the Loop. 
  Including repeats, 15 are located South of downtown, while only 5 are North of downtown.
- The numbers of graffiti requests and pot hole reports per year have declined since 2013, while the number of sanitation
  complaints have increased slightly. Reports of vacant buildings dropped from about 18,000 in 2013 to about 3,000 in 2014.
  The data shows no such reports after 2014.

For graffiti, potholes, and sanitation complaints, these areas are racially similar to 
the Cook County average of about 57%. However, areas reporting vacant/abandoned buildings 
are significantly more racially diverse and include more individuals living below the poverty 
line when compared to the other three report types. Each of these report types tends to come 
from areas with significantly more poverty than the Cook County average of about 7.5%.

PROBLEM 3 PART A
7500 S. Wolcott Ave is located in Ward 17 according to the City of Chicago: 
https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/lookup_ward_and_alderman.html

Graffiti ~ .19%
Potholes ~ .5% (most likely)
Sanitation ~ .27%
Vacant ~ .33%

PROBLEM 3 PART B
